# React-Project
Coding exercise with instructions to get information from the OMDb API and display it.

While I attempted several tactics with this assignment, most of my work is contained in the app.js file.

I was able to successfully create a search bar and make a call to the API reflecting the user input. The call is successful, as the Network tab in the console shows; however, I was unable to get the data to display.
